After expanding our Shopify Meetup events across Leeds and Manchester in July, we’re bringing both free events back on [Wednesday 18th October in Leeds](https://nvite.com/ShopifyMeetup/llzo84) and [Thursday 19th October in Manchester](https://nvite.com/ShopifyMeetup/4r4g87) for two more nights of eCommerce insight, networking and discussions on everything Shopify!

July was our first Shopify Meetup event in Manchester, and our fourth in Leeds. We had some fantastic feedback from both nights, and we’re excited to be bringing both back in October.

As the Shopify community in the North continues to flourish, we’re packing both free nights with inspiring eCommerce speakers, online retail networking and Shopify advice - perfect for growing your online business.

On Wednesday 18th October, our Shopify Meetup returns to Leeds for the fifth time with insight from inspirational Shopify brands, experts and partners and will come to a new venue, The Tetley. The following night, our second Shopify Meetup in Manchester will return again for another fantastic night at LEAF on Portland Street.

Both nights will be packed with valuable eCommerce advice and insight, and places always fill up fast, so don’t miss your chance to book a spot. We've taken on board a lot of feedback from our previous events and we've made sure that these meetups will offer actionable advice for the Christmas period - whether it's walking away with eCommerce personalisation tips from Nosto, SEO eCommerce tips from Tom Armenante, a list of recommended Shopify apps to use from us here at Statement, top eCommerce growth tips from Patchworks and finally some merchant inspiration from fast-growing Shopify store, Thyme.
