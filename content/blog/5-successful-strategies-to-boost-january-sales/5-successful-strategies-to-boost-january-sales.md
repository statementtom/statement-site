The holiday season can be a busy and stressful time for online retailers - and with the new year approaching, having a clear plan in place to ensure you make the most of this period is essential.

One significant, but often overlooked, element of the holiday period is the January sales - a key event for many brands.

January sees a massive influx of discounts and offers, and is a perfect time for getting rid of outdated and unwanted stock to make way for new arrivals for the new year.

To help you manage this crucial stage, here are some tips on how you can take advantage of the January sales.

  

#1 - Introduce New Deals and Offers ![New Year](../../annie-spratt-178364.jpg)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new year is a great opportunity to introduce a wide variety of new offers and deals to your customers.

*   Present time sensitive offers to customers - offer deals on a number of different products for a limited amount of time - this is a good way to ensure a significant rise in orders and traffic

*   Have a winter promotional giveaway - offer promotions on winter-specific items - such as warm clothing, winter themed food, or tools to combat the cold weather.

*   Gift card discounts - gift cards are a popular gift idea, meaning that many people will have received them over the Christmas period. Having offers such as 10% off all gift card purchases will give people an incentive to use them rather than leave it for later and forget.

  

#2 - Thank and Reward Loyal Customers
-------------------------------------

The new year is the perfect time to reward all of your loyal customers who have stayed with your business and brought in more revenue throughout the past year. Send targeted emails to those customers who have been your biggest asset during the year to reward them with an exclusive deal, or offer loyal customers a free gift with a purchase.

You could also provide them with the chance to see and trial new products before anyone else. This will allow customers to feel more valued and there’s a higher chance they will recommend you to others.

  

#3 - Take Advantage of New Year Resolutions
-------------------------------------------

January means New Year resolutions - a brilliant way for brands and businesses to benefit from targeted sales and increased engagement on social media. January is the perfect time to promote specific products that are related to popular New Year resolutions - for example, you could use this time to offer discounts on products promoting fitness and health.

  

#4 - Utilise Social Media ![Social Media](../../saulo-mohana-77106.jpg)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The holiday period sees a massive influx of new customers - make them feel welcome and encourage them to stay with your business by engaging with them on social media. This will take your customer service to the next level and ensure your customers feel welcomed and valued by your business.

  

#5 - “Coming Soon this Year” Sneak Peeks
----------------------------------------

Give your customers an incentive to come back and continue to stay with you even after the holiday season. Giving them sneak peeks on deals and new products that will be on offer in the upcoming months will help keep them interested and ensure that they keep coming back to your brand.

Build up to new launches through the use of social media, video content and email campaigns to keep customers looking forward to more - this will allow you to increase traffic and gain new customers before you launch new products and offers.

  

In Summary…
-----------

Making the most of the January sales can massively benefit your business and make a huge difference to the amount of sales, customers and engagement you receive, enabling you to have a successful holiday season, and ultimately setting you up for the rest of the year.

January sales don’t have to be just a reason to sell unwanted stock - it can also be a powerful marketing tool to gain new customers - and is a highly important time in securing customers that have joined you over the Christmas period.
