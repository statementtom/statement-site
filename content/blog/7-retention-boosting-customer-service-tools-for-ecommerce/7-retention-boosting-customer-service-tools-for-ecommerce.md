Having an eCommerce store that provides excellent customer service can make all the difference. Great service breeds loyalty with your customers, gives them the confidence to make a purchase and the trust to come back for another.

The good news is that there are plenty of fantastic customer service tools out there that can help you to improve your store’s level of service.

Whether you’re looking to keep in touch with customers, help them find information or just make the process as smooth and simple as possible, there’s a customer service tool that can help you.

Here are 7 retention boosting customer service tools for your eCommerce store:

  

Quick Facebook Chat
-------------------

Beeketing’s [Quick Facebook Chat](https://beeketing.com/quick-facebook-chat) app is available on various different eCommerce platforms, and provides a simple live chat solution for any store.

Live chat is a fantastic way of engaging naturally with visitors, helping them to make a decision and providing advice while on site.

Using live chat means you can talk to customers while they’re showing purchase intention, and Facebook chat has the added benefit of being a familiar service to your customers. It also stores chat data in their Facebook messages for easy access.

  

Facebook Messenger
------------------

Facebook Messenger is already an incredibly popular messaging app, and it’s now becoming a powerful customer service tool.

Similarly to live chat, Facebook Messenger gives your customers an approachable and familiar touch point. Facebook Messenger goes far beyond live chat though as Facebook continues to add functionality to the platform.

If you have a Shopify store for example, you can [recommend products to customer within messenger](https://www.shopify.co.uk/messenger), giving them a quick route to purchase.

Merchants on multiple platforms can also make use of Messenger for shipping notifications, delivery information and all manner of customer communication.

  

Klaviyo
-------

Email is still an incredibly important customer service tool, and platforms like [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) allow you to take your email marketing to the next level.

You can set up automated workflows to respond to everything from abandoned carts to repeat purchasing, helping you to stay in touch with customers in a personalised and relevant manner.

Making sure that your communication with customers is personalised is becoming more and more important.

Giving them a unique and tailored experience with tools like Klaviyo will help to improve your customer service, ensuring you’re always providing customers with the information they really need.

  

Zendesk
-------

For larger stores, a help desk tool like [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is essential.

Zendesk will enable you to store all of your customer communications in one place, manage your customer service agents and implement a support ticket system.

As your store grows, maintaining the same level of customer service can be tough, but tools like Zendesk allow you to organise and run your customer service operations efficiently.

You’ll also be able to add a knowledge base to your site, allowing customers to access a large support library and reducing the strain on your customer service team.

  

Return Magic
------------

When it comes to the customer experience, many merchants overlook the returns process. In fact, the returns experience can often be the difference between a dissatisfied customer, and a loyal shopper.

Apps like [Return Magic](https://www.returnmagic.com/) allow you to automate much of the process. You can generate return labels and set custom returns rules to create a personalised returns process.

You can also create custom returns forms to make it simple for customers to return their items and allow your customer service team to focus on assisting customers with more complex queries.

  

HelpCentre
----------

If you’re to provide excellent customer service, you’ll need to ensure that your support team’s time is being used effectively. [HelpCenter](https://apps.shopify.com/helpcenter) is a customer service tool that allows you to create a simple FAQs section for your store, enabling customers to find their own answers to issues.

HelpCentre means customers don’t have to make direct contact for customer service queries, and will help remove barriers to purchase.

Customers who are unsure about shopping on your eCommerce store will be able to reassure themselves without you having any personal contact.

  

Touchcard
---------

When it comes to customer service, you always want to go beyond a customer’s expectations. Touchcard is a simple tool that will help you do just that.

[Touchcard](https://touchcard.co/) can be integrated with your eCommerce store to automatically send personalised postcards to customers.

You can set triggers for posting out a card, and customise their design to include offers, promotions or just a simple thank you.

Sending a personal message by post lets you skip a customer’s cluttered email inbox and send them something unexpected.

  

In Summary…
-----------

Customer service is vital for the success of any eCommerce store. You need to provide a personal, informative and relevant service to customers that removes barriers to purchase and streamlines your shopping process.

Thanks to the many powerful tools out there, this is well within reach for your eCommerce store. Think about the customer service tools and channels that your customers respond to and create your own customer service strategy utilising some of the tools in this post.

If you can provide an excellent service to customers, they’ll keep coming back for more.
