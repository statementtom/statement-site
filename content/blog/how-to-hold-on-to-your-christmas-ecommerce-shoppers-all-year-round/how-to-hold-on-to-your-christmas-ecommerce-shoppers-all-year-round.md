The holiday season is a crucial period for businesses in that you will see a massive influx of new customers. You will need clear objectives on how to ensure these shoppers turn into lifelong customers and don’t just turn away after the holiday season.

But holding onto Christmas customers and keeping them interested can be tough work.

Here are our top tips on how to hold onto your Christmas shoppers all year round.

  

Make a Good First Impression
----------------------------

The first - and arguably the most important step - is to make a good first impression, one that will stay in the minds of your customers.

Making your customers feel welcome and valued is a great way to ensure they remember you.

Make sure your customer service is at its best and exceed customer expectations by going above and beyond to ensure your customers have a wonderful and memorable experience with your store - for example by exceeding delivery time rates or offering free gifts alongside first purchases.

Improving customer experience is a great way to make sure your new customers won’t easily forget you.

  

Invite Customers to Become a Part of Your Community
---------------------------------------------------

Invite your customers to become a part of your community - get to know them on a more personal level and develop an earnest bond with them. Invite them to join your loyalty program, use targeted emails to send customers deals and offers on products you know they will like and take on feedback so your customers feel valued knowing you listened to them.

Utilise social media to engage with your customers and learn more about them, and also to keep them up to date with any upcoming events or campaigns at your store.

Invest time in cultivating an emotional bond with your customers and welcoming them to your community.

  

Monitor Your Store Data
-----------------------

Get to know and understand your customers. Monitor their social media activity to learn more about their interests and hobbies etc, and track customers website activity to collect comprehensive data regarding their demographic, what items they purchased or looked at and what pages they visited on your site.

The data you collect is extremely valuable as it will allow you to target customers and keep them engaged and interested by sending them emails, reminders etc that are related to the information you have about them, and that is sure to grab their attention.

  

Re-engage with Shoppers  

--------------------------

With Christmas being such a hectic and busy time for all, chances are your Christmas customers will most likely forget about your brand once they’ve purchased whatever they need.

However, with accurate data and a comprehensive marketing plan, you can work on re-engaging customers a few weeks after Christmas - to re capture their attention, inform them about the brand and pique their interest.

A good time to re-engage with your customers is just before you launch a sale - give them a casual reminder of your business and then when you launch your sale, you will seem more familiar to your customer and they’ll be more likely to make a purchase.

  

Give Customers an Incentive to Come Back
----------------------------------------

Don’t just ask customers to subscribe to emails or follow you on social media - give them a reason to. Inform them of the exclusive perks and offers they could receive if they decide to follow you on social media sites or subscribe to your email list - they are more likely to come back if they are aware of what is in store for them!  

  

In Summary...  

----------------

Converting your holiday shoppers into lifelong customers is one of the most effective ways to ensure long time success for your eCommerce store.
