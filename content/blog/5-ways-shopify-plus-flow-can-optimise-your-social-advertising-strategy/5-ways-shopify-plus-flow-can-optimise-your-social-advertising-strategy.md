As your eCommerce store scales, managing social advertising campaigns becomes more complex and difficult to control.

But thanks to Shopify Plus’ Flow, high-growth stores can take control of their social advertising strategies, making them more targeted, personalised and relevant than ever before.

Flow allows your Plus store to set workflows, tag customers and trigger specific actions based on the criteria you set. This allows you to cut down on wasted time and eliminate repetitive tasks, but there are some fantastic benefits for your social advertising campaigns too.

Here are 5 ways you can use Flow to revitalise your Shopify Plus store’s social advertising strategy...

  

1\. Identify & Target High Value Customers
------------------------------------------

With Flow, identifying high-value customers and then targeting them with social ads is simple.

You can use Flow to tag customers who pass a certain spending threshold, or tend to make high volume orders. This allows you to quickly segment and target your social ads at customers who are likely to provide a much larger return on investment.

  

2\. Identify & Target Customers Who Convert Quickly
---------------------------------------------------

As well as being able to target high value customers, Flow also makes it easy for you to identify customers who are likely to convert quickly, serving them with tailored ads that add a sense of urgency.

If you’re looking for a short term sales boost to meet targets or get the most from a sale, this can be a great tactic.

  

3\. Pause Advertising for Out of Stock Products
-----------------------------------------------

No eCommerce retailer wants to waste social advertising budget on promoting products that customers can’t even buy.

Thanks to Flow, you can automatically notify the marketing team when stock runs low, or runs out all together, allowing them to pause ads promoting those products before budget is wasted.

You’ll also avoid disappointing customers who find themselves unable to make a purchase!

  

4\. Separate Wholesale Customers from B2C
-----------------------------------------

If you’re running both wholesale and B2C storefronts thanks to Shopify Plus’ wholesale channel, you’ll want to make sure to segment these customers in your social advertising.

With Shopify Plus’ Flow, this is as simple as automatically adding a tag to any wholesale orders.

This allows you to target social ads specifically at your wholesale customers, or even just exclude them from your B2C ads. After all, you don’t want to be spending money targeting your wholesale customers with retail pricing.

  

5\. Identify Customers Who Respond to Promotions
------------------------------------------------

Knowing which of your customers respond well to sales, discounts and promotions can be an invaluable tool when it comes to planning your social advertising strategy.

With Shopify Plus’ Flow, you can create workflows to identify and tag customers depending on their purchasing behaviour.So if a customers usually buys in sale periods, with a discount code or through a promotion, you can quickly segment them.
