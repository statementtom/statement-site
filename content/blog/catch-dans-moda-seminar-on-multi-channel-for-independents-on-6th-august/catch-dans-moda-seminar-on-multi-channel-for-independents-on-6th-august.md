We’re excited to announce that our MD Dan Conboy will be speaking at the UK’s largest fashion trade exhibition [MODA](https://www.moda-uk.co.uk/welcome) on Sunday 6th August.

Every year, MODA sees hundreds of the most innovative fashion brands around descend on the NEC in Birmingham, and MODA’s seminar program is one of the show’s highlights.

Dan will be taking to the stage at 10:30am to talk about multi-channel retailing for independents. He’ll be providing insights on the current state of eCommerce, how to get the most from multi-channel and how to get it right for your brand.

Selling across multiple channels is an important trend for fashion brands to take note of, and Dan will be sharing his over 10 years of eCommerce experience with the audience to help them take advantage of multi-channel opportunities.
