Shopify’s app store is a fantastic resource for merchants looking to add functionality to their store that will improve sales - and that’s no different when it comes to loyalty, referrals and affiliate marketing.

Loyalty, referral and affiliate marketing are all fantastic ways to increase the reach of your brand and bring in new customers, whilst also strengthening your existing customer base.

Thanks to the Shopify app store, it’s easier than ever before to start a loyalty or affiliate program for your own eCommerce store.

The Shopify app store has a wealth of fantastic apps that will get your affiliate program off the ground, or your loyalty scheme off to a flying start.

Here are 7 powerful loyalty, referral and affiliate marketing apps that will give your store a boost.

## Loyalty & Referral Apps

There are some fantastic loyalty and referral marketing apps in Shopify’s app store. With options to fit any budget and requirements, you’re sure to find an app that fits the needs of your eCommerce business well.

### Smile.io

[Smile.io](https://smile.io/?utm_campaign=Partner%20Ref&utm_source=Statement) is one of the most popular and well established loyalty and referral apps on the app store. It’s used by over 10,000 merchants and is free for up to 500 members, so there’s no reason not to give it a try.

Smile.io offers plenty of different ways of rewarding customers, from points for purchases through to referral bonuses. Just like in the example above from Shopify store [Dexters Workwear](https://www.dextersworkwear.co.uk/).

It also integrates well with Shopify POS, so your brick and mortar customers won’t be left out.

### Loyalty Lion

[Loyalty Lion](https://apps.shopify.com/loyaltylion) is another well established loyalty platform for Shopify, with plenty of merchants behind it.

You’ll find everything here for running a strong and flexible loyalty scheme, with plenty of ways to reward your customers and some great customisation options. You’ll also find some more advanced features as you move up through their package options.

Like Smile.io, Loyalty Lion also integrates well with Shopify POS to create a scheme that works just as well offline.

### Swell Rewards

If you’re looking to directly integrate your loyalty program with email marketing tools like Klaviyo, [Swell Rewards](https://apps.shopify.com/swell) and Referrals offers the option to display points balances and other scheme information in your emails.

It also comes with a fully featured referrals program that lets you create a branded scheme linked to your loyalty system.

### ReferralCandy

For those looking for a powerful referrals app that doesn’t come with any added loyalty features, [ReferralCandy](https://apps.shopify.com/referralcandy) could be the app for you.

Here, you’ll get a full referrals dashboard that lets you track revenue and activity. You can also fully brand and customise your scheme to decide when and how referrers are paid.

ReferralCandy is also used by huge brands like Tidal and Reebok, so you can be sure that you’re getting a powerful, reliable system.

## Affiliate Apps

As well as loyalty and referrals, starting an affiliate program for your store is another fantastic way of bringing in new customers. Influencers and bloggers have the potential to bring huge volumes of visitors to your store, and incentivising them with an affiliate marketing program is a great way of getting started.

### Affiliatly

[Affiliatly](https://www.affiliatly.com/) is a robust and full featured affiliate app for your Shopify store.

With Affiliatly, you’ll be able to manage and track your affiliate network, while individually managing each affiliate’s account.

You can create affiliate banners for influencers to use as part of their promotions, and their pricing structure scales well, so you won’t be hit with a huge jump in cost as your scheme grows.

### Enlistly

If you’re just getting started with affiliate marketing, [Enlistly](https://apps.shopify.com/enlistly) could be a good place to begin.

It doesn’t offer as full a feature set as other options in the app store, but comes in at a reasonable price and is easy to use.

You won’t have activity tracking for each link though, so attributing activity to your affiliates may be difficult.

### LeadDyno

[LeadDyno](https://apps.shopify.com/leaddyno) is more expensive than other options in this article, but it comes with one feature no other affiliate app can match at the moment. LeadDyno has its own affiliate network.

All plans come with access to their exclusive affiliate network, making getting your affiliate program up and running a little easier.

You’ll also find everything for managing and rewarding your affiliates, as well as a mobile app for management on the go.

## In Summary…

When it comes to running your own loyalty, referral or affiliate marketing program, the Shopify app store has everything you’ll need to make a success of it.

You’re sure to find the right solution for your store amongst the many and varied options Shopify has to offer.

Whether you’re just looking to get a taste for what loyalty, referrals and affiliate marketing can do for your store, or you’re ready to make a big investment, Shopify has the app for you.
