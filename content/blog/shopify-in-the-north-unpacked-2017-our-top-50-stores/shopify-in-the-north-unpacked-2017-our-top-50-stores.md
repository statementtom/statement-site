As Shopify experts based in Yorkshire, we continue to be amazed by the growth of beautiful, creative and exciting Shopify stores in the North of England.

Last year, we hosted the North’s very first Shopify Meetup event in Leeds, and we loved meeting loads of fantastic entrepreneurs, designers and store owners who’ve been helping to build a strong Shopify community up here.

A true testament to the growth of the platform in the North is the wealth of great stores flourishing in the Shopify community. We’ve come across plenty last year, and these are our favourites:

  

1\. Drop Dead Clothing - Sheffield
----------------------------------

Sheffield-based clothing brand [Drop Dead Clothing](https://www.dropdead.co/) have a beautiful, image focused site that really fits their rebellious brand image. Drop Dead’s clothing is unique and creative, and so is their site. The products take centre stage, creating an interactive and engaging experience.

The site also uses Shopify apps well, adding personalisation with Nosto and back in stock email alerts. Their social accounts have huge, loyal followings that really show the benefits of building a community around your brand.
