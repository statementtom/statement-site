After the success of our roundtable event in Leeds, we’re pleased to be bringing our eCommerce Roundtable to Black Milk in Manchester city centre on the topic of ‘common traits of high-growth eCommerce brands’ on Tuesday 26th June. [Request your free place today!](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ecommerce-roundtable-traits-of-high-growth-ecommerce-brands-tickets-46750806922)

The event makes for the perfect opportunity for eCommerce Managers, eCommerce Directors, Heads of eCommerce, Heads of Marketing, Marketing Managers etc. to discuss what it takes to be among the fastest growing brands online.

While high street retailers such as Maplin and Toys ‘R’ Us continue to face challenges, online brands like Gymshark, MVMT Watches and more are scaling quickly and flourishing.

But what's the secret to their success?

We will be bringing together eCommerce experts, partners and platforms for coffee and networking to discuss common retail challenges and aspirations - including Kobi McCardle (previously AO.com), Paul Levy (Bunting) and David Ingram (Bring Digital) with more experts yet to be announced. The event will be held in a safe environment chaired by Dan Conboy, Managing Director of Statement.

The roundtable takes place at Black Milk in Manchester on Tuesday 26th June from 10:00 to 12:00, and will discuss marketing strategies, platform choices, tools and software and more, all within a confidential environment.
