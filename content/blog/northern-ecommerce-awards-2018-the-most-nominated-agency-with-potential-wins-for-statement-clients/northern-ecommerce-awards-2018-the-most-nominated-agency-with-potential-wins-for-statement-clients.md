We’re excited to announce that Statement has been nominated for Best Small Agency at The Northern eCommerce Awards 2018! Plus with potential wins for clients Xercise4Less, Tatti Lashes, Tweak, Peter Reed and Lo-Dough, we’re the most nominated agency for the second year in a row!

Straight off the back of five nominations for the eCommerce Awards 2018, we’re incredibly proud of our clients and team for achieving a total of 8 nominations, plus a potential win for Lo-Dough in The “Best Food & Drink” category, with no shortlist being announced.

On the fantastic news of our nominations, our MD Dan said;

_“It’s fantastic to be nominated for 8 awards at this year’s Northern eCommerce Awards - that makes us the most nominated agency for the second year running. I’m really proud of the Statement team for their continued effort and dedication. Thanks also to our fantastic clients for providing us with the opportunity to work on such great projects.”_

In addition to our nomination for Best Small Agency, Statement clients have been nominated for;

*   Beauty, Health & Wellbeing - Tatti Lashes, Xercise4Less
*   DIY, Home, Furniture & Interior Design - Brooklyn Trading, Peter Reed, Tweak Slumber
*   eCommerce Startup - 4FiiT (Xercise4Less), Tatti Lashes

  

Shopify Dominates Among High-Growth Brands
------------------------------------------

We’re delighted to have received two of the total three nominations in the eCommerce Startup category! Not only that, but every brand nominated has chosen Shopify as their platform of choice, further cementing Shopify and Shopify Plus as the leading eCommerce platform choice for high growth brands.

We’re incredibly proud of Xercise4Less and Tatti Lashes for their hard work and well deserved nominations.

  

Showing Our Expertise in Home & Leisure
---------------------------------------

As well as having the most nominees in the eCommerce startup category, our clients have also dominated the Home & Leisure category, with three out of the four nominations.

It’s great to see our team’s hard work in the home and leisure vertical paying off, with an ever increasing group of fantastic clients in the sector such as nominees Peter Reed, Tweak Slumber and Brooklyn Trading.

  

Good Luck to All The Nominees
