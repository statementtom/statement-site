We’re excited to announce that our first ever Shopify Plus Meetup is heading to Manchester on Thursday 5th July. [Book your free place today!](https://ti.to/shopify-meetups/shopify-plus-meetup-manchester)

After holding three previous Shopify Meetups in Manchester, this time we’re returning with an event specially tailored to high-growth stores, specifically on the theme of **how your high-growth eCommerce store manages scale** - perhaps the biggest challenge for any high-growth store.

The event takes place at **LEAF on Portland St** on **Thursday 5th July** from **6pm - 8pm** and is a great opportunity for enterprise and growing eCommerce merchants to network, share insight and hear from speakers such as our sponsors [Brightpearl](https://www.brightpearl.com/) and [Patchworks](https://www.patchworks.co.uk/), and our Shopify Plus Retailer Panel including [Manière De Voir](https://www.manieredevoir.com/), [Lounge Underwear](https://loungeunderwear.com/) and more.

Speakers will look at how your store can manage operating at scale, as well as how you can prepare for peak trading periods.

A free bar and burgers will also be on offer for attendees so make sure to book today to avoid disappointment.
