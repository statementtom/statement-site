It’s been a fantastic past 12 months for all of us here at Statement; we’ve worked with some incredible eCommerce businesses, continued to run with our successful Shopify Meetups and other eCommerce events, and have gained Shopify Plus Experts status as an agency.

Now we’re happy to say we can top off what’s been an exciting year with nominations for both us and our clients in the Northern eCommerce Awards.

  

Statement - Small eCommerce Agency of the Year
----------------------------------------------

We’re excited to say that Statement has been nominated for Small eCommerce Agency of the Year!

From starting as an internal team within an existing eCommerce business back in 2010, to working with top brands like Xercise4Less and Goodwin Smith today, we’re incredibly proud of our growing team and amazing collection of clients.

We’ve also been working hard not only to grow our own clients’ businesses, but to grow the eCommerce community as a whole; holding Shopify Meetups in Leeds and Manchester to bring eCommerce store owners together as well as hosting eCommerce events in Leeds Business Week and beyond.

  

Multiple Nominations for Our Clients…
-------------------------------------

In addition to our own nomination, our client Lo-Dough has been nominated for two Northern eCommerce Awards!

Being nominated both for Food & Drink eCommerce Website of the Year, as well as eCommerce Startup of the Year is a well deserved accolade for the Lo-Dough team, who’ve worked hard since launch to bring their innovative bread alternative product to market, and with some incredible results!

Our client Goodwin Smith has also been nominated for Fashion / Apparel or Footwear eCommerce Website of the Year!

Goodwin Smith has never been afraid to say what other brands daren’t, and their fearless approach to marketing, combined with a fantastic Shopify store makes them more than a worthy nominee.

  

Fingers Crossed!
----------------

Its amazing to see the work of our team and of our clients recognised with nominations for such fantastic awards.

The [Northern eCommerce Awards 2017](https://northernecommerceawards.com/) takes place on **11th October at Manchester Cathedral**. We want to wish everyone nominated good luck, and we can’t wait for what promises to be a fantastic night!
