eCommerce continues to be a growing part of our economy, with an estimated £116 billion of sales made online in the UK in 2015. However, many businesses are still not maximising the opportunities that come from selling online.

Research shows that businesses often perceive selling online as too difficult, costly or complicated. To reach out to these businesses and offer their support, local digital agency [Statement](https://www.statementagency.com/) and logistics specialists [Konnexus](https://www.konnexus.co.uk) are working in partnership to deliver an open, growth-focused seminar for retailers, using their knowledge and expertise to help facilitate eCommerce growth across Wakefield.

Statement’s own client base includes a number of eCommerce and retail clients across the region, including some well-known Wakefield-based businesses, such as Trinity Walk Shopping Centre, IndiaCoco and Peter Jones. Similarly, Konnexus provide a range of drop shipping and warehouse fulfillment services to eCommerce businesses across the nation and have a wealth of expertise in implementing efficient operational systems for online retailers.

The seminar, entitled ‘[The Smart Way to Grow Your eCommerce Business](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-smart-way-to-grow-your-ecommerce-business-tickets-19929391346)’, will be held at Wakefield One on 3rd February 2016, and will cover a variety of key topics that retailers will need to be aware of to grow their business in the new digital era – from building a strong retail brand online, to marketing their products, to putting smart logistics in place to manage day-to-day operations.

Dan Conboy, Director at Statement, comments, “_eCommerce represents an excellent opportunity for businesses within the Leeds City Region to increase their revenues and expand into new markets, including those abroad. Our seminar, delivered in partnership with Konnexus, will showcase how to develop a smart eCommerce plan to kick-start growth and maximise the potential of this business channel._”
