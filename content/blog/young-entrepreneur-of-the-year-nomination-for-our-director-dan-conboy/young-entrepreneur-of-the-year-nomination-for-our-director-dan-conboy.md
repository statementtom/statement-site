**After just recently receiving the fantastic news that we’ve been** [**nominated for 4 Northern eCommerce Awards**](https://www.statementagency.com/blog/2017/09/northern-ecommerce-awards-nominations-for-statement-lo-dough-goodwin-smith)**, we’re proud to announce that our Managing Director, Dan Conboy has been nominated for** [**Young Entrepreneur of the Year at the Digital Entrepreneur Awards**](https://www.digital-entrepreneur.co.uk/finalists.html)**!**

Since starting Statement back in 2010 as an internal team in an existing eCommerce business, Dan has grown Statement into the North’s leading Shopify eCommerce agency for growing brands.

After suffering poor experiences with agencies while leading an internal team, Dan has always put clients at the centre of everything we do, providing great customer service and going beyond expectations to help clients reach their goals.

Dan continues to take Statement from strength to strength, with the recent achievement of Shopify Plus Experts status, and the addition of huge brands to the Statement portfolio, including Xercise4Less, Goodwin Smith, Bonmarché and Betty’s & Taylor’s.

Dan commented:

> “Just to be shortlisted within this category means a great deal. I have admired many individuals that have taken the Young Entrepreneur title, while also watching some outstanding businesses take to the stage to showcase the fantastic work that digital businesses are delivering in the North. Whilst my name may be on the shortlist, it’s my talented team that have also helped me and the Statement business deliver great things!”

It’s amazing to see Dan nominated for such a prestigious award, and we can’t wait for the Digital Entrepreneur Awards in Manchester on 22nd November for what promises to be a fantastic night!
