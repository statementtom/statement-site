The third Shopify Meetup Leeds event has been announced for Wednesday 8th March at The Adelphi in Leeds.

We are continuing to host our successful Shopify Meetup events for retailers, agencies and eCommerce thought leaders to discuss all things Shopify and online retail. The previous two events have had such great feedback that we are pleased to announce that we are hosting a third event with new speakers and new discussions – with this event focusing on Shopify apps and add-ons.

Our event will feature a guest panel of app developers including Brightpearl and ReCharge Payments who will be discussing retail management, subscriptions and sharing their experience of working with thousands of retailers globally. There will also be a retailer story from a Shopify user who will discuss how they have grown using the platform.

The event is open to all – whether you’re an existing retailer on Shopify, a start-up looking for a platform or are simply unhappy with your current eCommerce platform and are looking for other options.

If you want to book your place for the event and connect with retailers, developers and agencies, [you can do so here](https://nvite.com/ShopifyMeetup/b6bb).
