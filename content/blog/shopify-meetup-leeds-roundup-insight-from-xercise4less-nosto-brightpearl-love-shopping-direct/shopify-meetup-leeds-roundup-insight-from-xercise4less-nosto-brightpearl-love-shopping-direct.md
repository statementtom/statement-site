Straight off the back of our Shopify Meetup in Manchester, we brought the event to Leeds for the 9th time for another night packed with eCommerce insight, this time aimed at getting Shopify merchants prepared for the peak trading season.

This time hosted at Duke Studios, eCommerce experts from [Nosto](https://www.nosto.com/), [Brightpearl](https://www.brightpearl.com/), [Xercise4Less](https://4fiit.xercise4less.co.uk/) and Love Shopping Direct shared their stories and tips for the most successful peak trading season yet.

----------------------------------------------------------

From the introduction of AR capabilities to enhanced fraud protection and Shopify Plus Flow Connectors, Tom walked through how Shopify continues to help support merchant growth through fast innovation and access to the latest technologies.

  

The 4FiiT Personal Training Story: Joe Hall @ Xercise4Less
----------------------------------------------------------

Next up was Joe from [Xercise4Less](https://4fiit.xercise4less.co.uk/). Joe talked attendees through how Xercise4Less uses Shopify to sell their 4FiiT personal training packages online.

Joe explained how Shopify became the solution to a host of problems for the gym chain. They previously had no way of allowing members to purchase personal training online, with all bookings needing to be made at the gym.With no way to effectively market sessions, Joe explained that revenue was slipping through the gym chain’s fingers as a result.

By selling their personal training sessions and Transformation Camps through Shopify, Xercise4Less are now able to employ targeted email and social advertising strategies to capitalise on demand for 4FiiT.

Joe also walked through their email and social advertising strategies for peak trading and Black Friday.

  

Personalising The eCommerce Journey For Peak Trading: Max @ Nosto
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Next up was Max from eCommerce personalisation platform [Nosto](https://www.nosto.com/).

Max explained how personalising the on-site customer journey can help to boost conversion rate for peak, and give each and every visitor a unique experience.Max walked through how Nosto analyses user data to create segments and provide a personalised experience, offering everything from product recommendations and personalised emails, to pop-ups and Facebook ads.

As Max explained;

_“With Nosto’s new Content Personalisation offering you can now leverage all the data we collect on visitors to automatically transform the way they experience your store.”_

Peaks in Demand & The Back Office: Rob Beattie @ BrightPearl & Andy Lockley @ Love Shopping Direct
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To close out the Meetup, back-office solution provider [Brightpearl](https://www.brightpearl.com/) brought along client Love Shopping Direct to walk through how Brightpearl, along with the rest of their technology stack, is helping them prepare for a unique peak trading situation.

With multiple stores selling everything from bulbs to dehumidifiers, peak trading can be unpredictable for Love Shopping Direct.

Andy explained how Shopify Plus and Brightpearl allows them to be ready for sales peaks, maintaining efficiency and service levels and capitalising as soon as demand rises.

As Andy explained;

_“Despite not knowing when peak might hit, we are able to automate sales orders, manage high volumes of orders and implement late shipping cut offs for warehouses to make the most of peak.”_
