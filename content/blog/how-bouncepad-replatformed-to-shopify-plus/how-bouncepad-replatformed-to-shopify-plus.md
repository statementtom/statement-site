[Bouncepad](https://www.bouncepad.com/) are market leaders in tablet accessories for businesses, and are suppliers to big brands such as McDonald’s and Citroen. Selling a varied range of durable and beautiful tablet accessories, the brand has grown significantly since their launch.

Their growing product range has proved to be highly popular with retailers and businesses alike.

Recently, the brand took the decision to replatform their ageing online store to Shopify Plus.

The enterprise platform’s wealth of powerful features, ability to seamlessly integrate with tools and apps such as Brightpearl and more encouraged the brand to move their store over to Shopify Plus.

Here’s how we worked with Bouncepad to replatform to Shopify Plus and create multiple expansion stores to bring their products to a new, international audience.

## Tell us a little about your stores and your business.

_Bouncepad is the global market leader in tablet enclosures, renowned for high quality products & excellent customer service._

_We assemble, quality check and ship all orders from our London-based HQ. We are in control, easy to deal with & accountable for every product we ship._

_We design with empathy to identify user pain-points and create functional, desirable products that improve the daily experience of millions of people while they work, shop, learn and play._

## What were the challenges you were facing in the business that led to the decision to replatform?

_Our website and e-commerce setup had too many moving parts, which meant things went wrong often. We needed more control over the setup so that we could make changes quickly and test improvements to our experience._

## Why Shopify Plus?

_Because we’re based in London, but service clients all over the world, we needed a platform that provided consistent uptime with little to no maintenance. That, plus the amount of integrations and apps available, made Shopify Plus the right choice._

## Why Statement?

_We wanted to work with a team that truly understood what we were trying to achieve. Statement provided a genuinely collaborative approach to the project, and we knew that we could continue to work with them on improvements and expansion once the site was launched._

## Since migrating to Shopify Plus, what benefits have you seen?

_E-commerce sales have become a larger proportion of our business, with the average basket size increasing thanks to the trust signals our new site provides. The new site is a much better reflection of who we are as a brand._

## What advice would you give to an eCommerce business looking to migrate, and thinking about Shopify Plus?

_Take your time during the discovery phase, especially when clearly identifying the problem(s) you are trying to solve. It can feel like a lot of work, but it saves so much time further into the project._

## What’s next for Bouncepad?

_We’ll be broadening our marketing activity using the tools that Shopify Plus gives us, as well as making it easier for our customers to find exactly what they need._

Working on continued growth and scalability is the brands main aim at the moment, Bouncepad are hoping their expansion strategy will bring in a more global audience. With Shopify Plus’ abilities to cater to international customers, this is definitely achievable.
