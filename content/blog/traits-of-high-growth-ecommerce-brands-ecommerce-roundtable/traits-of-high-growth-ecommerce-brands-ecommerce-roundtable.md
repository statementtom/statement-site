As part of [Leeds Digital Festival](https://leedsdigitalfestival.org/), we brought together eCommerce retailers, key eCommerce service providers and other eCommerce experts from across the north of England to discuss the common traits of high-growth eCommerce brands at Duke Studios in Leeds.

With the growth of digitally native vertical brands and eCommerce ‘pure plays’ like GymShark and MVMT Watches reporting record-high sales, we wanted to provide a confidential forum for eCommerce experts to discuss the challenges they face, the common traits of high-growth success and, most importantly, what to put in place for their own businesses to see fast growth and scale.

Attendees from the likes of [Xercise4Less](https://4fiit.xercise4less.co.uk/), [Apothecary 87](https://www.apothecary87.co.uk/) and [Bring Digital](https://www.bringdigital.co.uk/) covered everything from strategy and platform, to marketing and conversion for high-growth eCommerce.

Thanks to everyone who attended what was an insightful and inspiring roundtable event. We’ll be exploring future eCommerce events throughout the year, to bring together thought leaders within the online retail space, so subscribe to our newsletter to be the first to hear.
