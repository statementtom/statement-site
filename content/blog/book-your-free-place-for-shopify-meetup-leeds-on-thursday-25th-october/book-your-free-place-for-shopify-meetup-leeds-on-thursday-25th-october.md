**Our Shopify Meetup returns to Leeds for the seventh time on Thursday 25th October from 6 - 8pm, for another night packed with insight and inspirational stories from high-growth eCommerce retailers.**

eCommerce experts and retailers will be on hand to discuss optimising your store, marketing your brand and streamlining your processes, ready for the most important period on the annual eCommerce calendar.

A well planned peak trading period can make the difference between a successful and unsuccessful year for your eCommerce business, so join us at [Duke Studios](https://goo.gl/maps/jBKZUCPr6Lz) in Leeds and make this year your best yet. As usual, there will be free food on offer for all attendees too.
