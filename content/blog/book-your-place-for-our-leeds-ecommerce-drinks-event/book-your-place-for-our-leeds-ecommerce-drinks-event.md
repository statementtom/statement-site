We’re excited to announce our first Leeds eCommerce Drinks event - a relaxed evening for eCommerce store owners, eCommerce Managers, Marketing Managers and similar roles to share their stories and experiences in managing high-growth online stores. [Request your place today.](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ecommerce-drinks-networking-event-tickets-46433025429)

The eCommerce community in Leeds and across the North is thriving, and this event is the perfect opportunity to share insight, experiences or just catch up over a drink. No speakers, no hard sell from agencies, just eCommerce merchants sharing war stories and sharing tips. Drink tokens will be provided for a range of select drinks.

The event takes place on Tuesday 19th June at The Brewery Tap in Leeds from 5-7pm, with tickets offered on a request only basis.

Drinks will be held in a private space, with tickets reserved exclusively for eCommerce merchants.
