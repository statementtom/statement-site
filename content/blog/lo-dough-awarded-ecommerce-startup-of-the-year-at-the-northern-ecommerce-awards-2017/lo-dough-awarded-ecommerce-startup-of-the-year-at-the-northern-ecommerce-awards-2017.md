After a fantastic night for the Statement team and our clients at the [Northern eCommerce Awards](https://northernecommerceawards.com/), we’re proud to say that [Lo-Dough](https://lodough.co/) has been named eCommerce Startup of the Year!

Joined by eCommerce stores, agencies, developers and more from across the North of England, the Statement team had a night to remember at the Northern eCommerce Awards at the grand Manchester Cathedral. Out of four nominations, resulting in us being the most nominated agency at the event, we were delighted to see our client Lo-Dough walking away with the eCommerce Startup of the Year award.

Lo-Dough have had an amazing first year, with incredible sales and a fantastically positive response to their brand new bread alternative product - which you can see a highlight of [here in our case study](https://www.statementagency.com/results/lo-dough).

Conversion rates of over 15% at peak times (it has to be seen to be believed!), paired with a Shopify store clearly focused around the user journey have helped Lo-Dough get off to a flying start.

It’s been a pleasure to work with the Lo-Dough team, and we can’t wait to see what they do next.

Congratulations to all of this year’s winners and everyone nominated, and we’re already looking forward to another year of eCommerce celebrations.
