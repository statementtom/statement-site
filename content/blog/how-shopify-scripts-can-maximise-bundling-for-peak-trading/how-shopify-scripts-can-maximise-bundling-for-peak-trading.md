Bundling relevant and related products together is a powerful promotional strategy that encourages customers to increase average order value and helps to boost sales for your store. But having to adjust pricing and calculating different costs for different bundles can be a challenge - and that’s where [Shopify Scripts](https://apps.shopify.com/script-editor?ref=statement&utm_campaign=Statement%20Blog) comes in.

Shopify Scripts can personalise shoppers checkout experience based on what they have placed in their cart. Here’s how they can enable retailers to take advantage of bundling items for peak trading.

  

Enable Bundle Discounting
-------------------------

Offering discounts on bundled products is made easier with Shopify Scripts. Scripts automatically detects what is placed in a shoppers cart at a specific moment, and then offers the discount to customers based on this information.

You can write up a Script to offer specific discounts codes if a specific combination of items are in a customers shopping cart, complimented by messaging on site to encourage them to buy more. They will then be getting the bundle of items at a cheaper price than they would have done if they had purchased the products individually.

Offer Gift Wrapping
-------------------

Offering gift wrapping in a bundle when shoppers purchase a product can be enabled through Shopify Scripts. Ideal for the holiday season, Scripts can allow you to tailor your customers’ shopping cart to add gift wrapping to specific products, calculating it as a bundle and offering it at a discounted price.

This can be particularly effective during the peak trading season, as more and more of your customers will be gift shopping, and so offering wrapping with products will be more appealing to your customers, especially if it looks to be more cost effective for them.

  

Buy One Get One Free Discounts
------------------------------

BOGO discounts can come in a number of different forms. For example, you may have a “Buy One Get One Free” offer on a particular product, but you may also offer discounts if a customer buys more than one of the product.

This is another effective way to encourage shoppers to buy more, and can be even more useful during peak trading as customers will be more likely to buy multiple of the same product for gifts.

Shopify Scripts allows users to easily implement and enable this promotional feature. MMA Warehouse use Scripts to promote BOGO offers, as shown below:

Upselling and Cross-selling
---------------------------

Use Shopify Scripts to optimise your upsell opportunities and encourage customers to increase their purchase and average order value. Upselling is a highly effective way of pushing customers towards buying complementary items together. You could also go a step further and cross-sell to customers after they have added a particular item to cart.

This provides customers with an incentive to spend more and buy related items together rather than individually if it provides more overall value. Shopify allows you to write up Scripts that offer upsells to customers, helping you to make the most of any and all opportunities that may come up for both upselling and cross-selling.

  

Summary
-------

Shopify Scripts is a great tool that enables eCommerce merchants to easily discount a combination or bundle of items based on what is placed in a customer's cart, encouraging customers to spend more for added value.
