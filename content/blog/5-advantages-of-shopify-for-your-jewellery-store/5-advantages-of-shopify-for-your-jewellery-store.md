Shopify is a fantastic platform for retailers in the fashion and accessories sectors, both large and small, to grow their businesses. So when it comes to selecting the right eCommerce platform for your jewellery store, there really is no better option.

With Shopify, you’ll be able to take advantage of everything from social selling and beautiful design to international sales and powerful integrations.

Not only does Shopify have a host of amazing features for jewellery store owners, but you’ll be doing all of this within a simple and efficient interface.

Here are 5 advantages of choosing Shopify for your jewellery eCommerce store.

  

1\. Sell with Social
--------------------

Social media is an incredibly important tool for growing your jewellery brand.

You’ll want to build a community around your products and create plenty of social proof to help potential customers to take that final step and make a purchase.

Shopify has some fantastic built in features for selling with social media. You can sell your products right from Facebook with a dedicated Facebook store, and Shopify also has sales channels for selling with other social networks like Pinterest.

New ways to sell with Shopify are always being added, so you can be sure that you’ll have access to the widest audience possible.

  

2\. Focus on Growth
-------------------

Unlike other eCommerce platforms, Shopify has a clear focus on its merchants’ business needs and requirements.

Instead of a complex and unintuitive interface, you’ll find an easy to use dashboard filled with everything you’ll need to run a business.

You can even keep track of your sales on the go using the Shopify app.

Shopify is a fully hosted solution, so you won’t have to worry about technical things like SSL certificates and PCI compliance. Shopify takes care of everything on your behalf.

This all allows you to stop worrying about building and coding an online store - you can focus on your products and your marketing.

  

3\. Build with Beautiful Themes
-------------------------------

When it comes to the design of your jewellery store, Shopify offers a wide range of different options.

You can choose to have a bespoke theme developed to your exact specifications by a Shopify Expert, or you can pick from Shopify’s wide range of high quality themes.

If you opt for a bespoke theme, you can create a totally custom storefront that fits the exact needs of your jewellery business and shows your products off in exactly the way you want.

If you decide to pick out an existing theme, you’ll still be able to customise a large amount of the look of your store, adding branding and colours to match your brand.

As the Shopify theme store has such a wealth of great themes, you’re sure to find something that fits your business.

  

4\. Sell across the World
-------------------------

For a growing jewellery business, just selling in one country barely scratches the surface of what your store can achieve.

With Shopify, you can easily expand your store to sell to multiple countries around the world.

Shopify will take care of local tax rates for your different markets, making navigating international selling a whole lot easier.

You’ll also be able to set up local shipping rates for each country and make sure that you give the best price possible to every customer.

  

5\. Take Advantage of Powerful Apps
-----------------------------------

The features that come with your Shopify subscription are only a small amount of the opportunities that come with Shopify thanks to the app store.

Shopify’s app store contains hundreds of different apps, all of a high quality, that can add great additional functionality to your store.

You could add a lookbook like the example below from [Biko](https://www.ilovebiko.com/) for example.

You could add everything from email marketing and accounting integrations to a ‘shoppable’ Instagram feed. Whatever your jewellery store needs, you’re sure to find a solution on the Shopify app store.

  

In Summary…
-----------

Whether you’re just starting out, or looking to take your jewellery eCommerce store to the next level, Shopify is a fantastic platform that will give you access to a host of powerful features for growing your business.

You’ll be able to sell on social, meeting your customers wherever they choose to interact with your brand. You’ll also be able to manage your store without fuss or an interface that gets in the way.

Opting for Shopify will give you a reliable and forward looking eCommerce platform that will serve your store well for years to come.
