eCommerce sales across the world are continuing to grow, but so are the competition and ever-changing market conditions. In such a dynamic space, it’s vital to look ahead and anticipate what will change the game so you can adapt your own strategy and maintain a competitive advantage.

At this event we’ll be bringing together a panel of some of the region’s leading eCommerce thought leaders to discuss their views on how eCommerce will evolve over the next 3 years, followed by an interactive Q&A session.  
  

Panellists include:

*   **Stuart Pick, Director at Brightpearl**
*   **Nick Stubbs, International eCommerce Manager at EJOT**
*   **Gavin Masters, Head of Consulting at Maginus**

_Further panellists to be confirmed.

The event will be chaired by **Dan Conboy, MD of Statement.**

It’ll be a great opportunity to be both inspired and informed, as well as providing the opportunity to network with other like-minded professionals within the eCommerce space.
