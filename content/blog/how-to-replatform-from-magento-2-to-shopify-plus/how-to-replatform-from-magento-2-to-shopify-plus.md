Two of the most popular eCommerce platforms for high growth, enterprise retailers, both Shopify Plus and Magento 2 are designed to cater to the unique needs and preferences of eCommerce brands that operate at scale.

The past few years however, have seen a staggering amount of retailers replatform from Magento 2 to Shopify Plus.

Whilst each individual store has their own reasons for migrating, common factors that push a merchant to migrate their store from Magento 2 includes excessive expenses, technical issues, reliability and security concerns etc.

We’ve put together a blog post to guide those eCommerce merchants who are looking to replatform from Magento 2 to Shopify Plus.

## Planning Your Migration

Shopify Plus provides eCommerce merchants who are looking to move from Magento 2 with all the tools and resources they need to ensure the migration process goes as smoothly as possible.

All Shopify Plus merchants are able to liaise with consultants and Solutions Engineers, who will work closely with you to map out your business requirements, understand your organisational goals and will even take your industry’s competitors into consideration.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ieeHhQcPBOB_8A91NsGVXVqvZCZPK0Hc-6WYVHDmla22HAzhC5KXxtsmp2ApN2kDJ8L8sQWbWGH5rJu6lE3Ok_QrhFAtRmp2cgXpPpT2yhxwOk9cs6hpNEcLrLY38nvrlipz0Q2i)

You will then be assigned a Launch Engineer who will act as your Project Manager, and work with you to coordinate timelines, deliverables and roles.

Your chosen Shopify Plus agency will also work with you to map out your needs and requirements, helping you to make the best choices when replatforming.

Alternatively, you can work with a replatforming consultant such as [Paul Rogers of Vervaunt](https://paulnrogers.com/services/ecommerce-replatforming-consulting/) to receive guidance and support on replatforming your eCommerce store.

## Design Considerations

![](<../../making-changes-to-mobile-wireframes_925x_(1).jpg>)The design of your store will need to be taken into account before replatforming. Many merchants use replatforming as a good time to refresh the design of their store, or completely redesign.

Regardless of whether you choose to do either, design will still require some thought when you migrate from Magento 2 to Shopify Plus. For example, you’ll have to think about whether you want a bespoke build or a customised theme

Shopify Plus is highly customisable and has a range of high quality theme designs to choose from, and also provides you with the capability to create your own bespoke design.

Whether you opt for a theme customisation or decide to design something entirely bespoke, Shopify Plus’ flexibility allows you to easily achieve the benefits of either.

## Data migration

Data migration is an incredibly important aspect to keep in mind when replatforming from Magento 2 to Shopify Plus. While this may seem risky at first, Shopify Plus makes it easier with the use of secure apps and integrations to make shifting your data easier and quicker.

Shopify Plus makes data migration as simple as possible. Shopify Plus’ Launch Engineers can guide you and help you to select the right replatforming tools for your store.

Depending on the expertise of your chosen agency, you may find that they have the specialisms and relevant processes in place to handle your data migration as part of your wider project.

Furthermore, on Shopify Plus you will have access to tools such as Transporter, a command line tool and Shopify app with accelerated import speeds. Whilst this is still in development for Magento 2, the principles can assist with migration. Apps such as [Excelify](https://excelify.io/) can also provide a lot of assistance with data transfer.

The platforms restful API and ready-made SDK’s integrate with all major PIMs, ERPs, CRMs and more. This gives you many different and secure options for transferring all your data and content. Find the best tool for your store and shift your data as quickly and easily as possible.

## Apps / integrations

Shopify Plus integrates with some of the most popular and common eCommerce apps and 3rd party tools to ensure merchants are provided with all the functionality and resource required.

Shopify Plus vet every app and plugin before adding it to their app store to ensure that it is safe and optimised for all its users. You can be sure to find the right apps for your store that will enable any and all the functionality you require when on Shopify Plus.

The enterprise platform also comes with apps designed specifically to cater to the complex needs of high growth brands that are free to use for those on the platform. This includes the powerful automation tool [Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow), [Launchpad](https://apps.shopify.com/launchpad) which helps you to pre schedule any campaigns or site changes etc and Scripts, a checkout customisation feature.

Together with your agency, you can map out your requirements and outline what exactly it is you’d need on your new store. Your agency will help you to find the right apps that fulfil these requirements, and can also find you apps that will replicate the required and relevant functionality from your existing store.

Furthermore, if the available apps do not suit or meet your store’s requirements, Shopify Plus allows you to build custom functionality to cater to your store’s individual needs.

## SEO

Replatforming an eCommerce store can sometimes impact your site’s SEO rankings. However, Shopify Plus consultants will work with you and find the right apps and plugins to ensure your SEO isn’t massively impacted.

It’s a good idea to put together a checklist of procedures to follow that will minimise the risk replatforming could have on your SEO. This could include installing page redirects, monitor duplicate content, track 404 errors, optimising for mobile, testing site speed and more.

You will also be able to work with an SEO or Shopify Plus agency to assist in the set up of 301 redirects to ensure that changes in URL structures are catered for, and you minimise the impact of these changes in search engine results pages.

Shopify Plus also comes with a number of SEO apps and plugins such as [SEO Manager](https://apps.shopify.com/seo-meta-manager), [Crush.pics](https://apps.shopify.com/crush-pics), [SEO Doctor](https://apps.shopify.com/kudobuzz-seo) and more that, when installed and integrated with your store, will help to fix, improve and drive SEO for your eCommerce store.

## Your Next Steps

Replatforming from Magento 2 to Shopify Plus requires careful thought and planning, but once you move over you will be able to see the full benefits of the platform.

We’ve covered some of the main aspects that you’ll need to consider before replatforming, including:

- Planning
- Design
- Data Migration
- Apps & Integrations
- SEO

Shopify Plus is fast becoming the platform of choice for high growth eCommerce brands, with merchants moving away from Magento 2 in favour of a platform that guarantees more security, reliability, scalability and more, all for a more cost effective option.
