One of the biggest dates in the global eCommerce calendar has come and gone - and now it’s time to review the numbers and have a look at the key takeaways and statistics from this year's Black Friday Weekend.

A Record Breaking Year for Shopify
----------------------------------

This year, Shopify experienced their highest ever Black Friday sales - with more than $1million in sales per minute - a massive rise from their $555,716 last year, and up to 7,957 orders per minute at the peak of the day.

Cyber Monday was also quite successful, with $309,268 sales and 3,349 orders per minute.

What’s more, Shopify had a [BFCM Live Data Dashboard](https://www.shopify.com/datastories?ref=statement&utm_campaign=Statement%20Blog) - which showed live updates from around the world and real time data tracking consumer rush (which was exciting to just watch!). It also included a breakdown of what was selling more in product categories, and tracked sales and orders per minute on a live map of the world.

What the Black Friday Data Shows
--------------------------------

Black Friday 2017 saw an increase in mobile orders - seeing a continued drop in desktop orders.

66% of orders were made by phone or tablet, up from 58% in 2016, whilst desktop sales were only at 34% this year compared to 42% last year - showing a noticeable shift from desktop to mobile.

The biggest buys this year were in apparel, closely followed by accessories - with over 1 million items purchased in both those categories, with the lowest purchases in games at 43,713.

According to Shopify, the total estimated distance for Black Friday packages to be shipped surpassed 5 billion miles - farther than Pluto is from Earth!

  

Advantages of Using Shopify for Black Friday Weekend
----------------------------------------------------

As Shopify Plus Experts, we helped many of our clients experience a great Black Friday Weekend, and Shopify had a number of different resources that were extremely valuable in helping eCommerce stores to prepare for the period. These tools undoubtedly helped in allowing Shopify merchants to manage their store efficiently over BFCM.

Gymshark’s Black Friday Story
-----------------------------

Shopify also ensures less downtime - so you won’t need to worry about problems occurring when traffic surges during peak times on Black Friday weekend - preventing the issues that occurred when UK’s fastest growing eCommerce brand [Gymshark](https://uk.gymshark.com/) used a Magento platform for their site in 2015.

After many months of waiting - their site was all set up and ready to go right before Black Friday 2015, only to have it crash almost immediately, causing GymShark to lose not only an estimated £100,000, but also the trust of their customers.

Ten months later, Gymshark switched to Shopify and continued to grow!
