#1 - "_Black Friday and Cyber Monday is such a fantastic opportunity for retailers. It may sound obvious, but as a former online retailer myself, my top tip is to plan way ahead!_

_It may be a sin to mention the_ _'__Christmas' word in the middle of May, but that's the best time to start your planning and preparations._

_Everything from sourcing your stock to creating your marketing collateral, the sooner you plan ahead the more time you'll have to ensure you have put in place the best possible promotions that will drive the best sales for your store at this pivotal time in the retail trading calendar."_

#2 - _"Black Friday isn’t just one day of sale nowadays, it’s an event that covers not only the weekend but the whole week for some retailers_ _\-_ _if you can, start your offer with a pre-sale to get in early against your competition._

_However, this will only work if you have a strong marketing campaign around it with a theme, a message and a cause_ _\-_ _customers can spot a sale that exists for the sake of it but if you can craft a week of relevant offers, inspiring competitions, engaging giveaways etc. it can be worth it."_

#3 - _"You should also begin a marketing campaign that focuses on collecting customer data a month in advance_ _\-_ _a competition to build social media likes, email addresses or website visitors. This will ensure you have a bank of recent and relevant customers that you can then market to on Black Friday through social activity, email campaigns and remarketing ads."_

#4 _\-_ _"It’s really important t_o f_ocus on optimising your store's speed to ensure your customers can easily navigate through the entire checkout process without experiencing slow load times._

_Large images, unnecessary apps/extensions and an unstable platform can all contribute to a slow shopping experience and therefore an unhappy customer_ _who ends up missing out on time or stock limited deals."_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 - "_I’d say something that’s often overlooked is having a plan for following up on your Black Friday and Cyber Monday successes afterwards._

_You’re bound to attract plenty of new customers and you need a plan to retain them after Black Friday. The Christmas shopping season doesn’t end after Cyber Monday, so a post-Black Friday plan is key to ensure you see a benefit from the sale event after the day itself."_

#6 - "_My top tip would be to k__eep_ _your store design_ _simple._ _For a customer, t__he process of finding a product, gathering all of the information needed, and then commit__t__ing to a purchase should be as easy as possible._

_Your site's design and structure_ _on Black Friday_ _should accommodate this as much as possible__, especially when customers are eager to purchase quickly."_
