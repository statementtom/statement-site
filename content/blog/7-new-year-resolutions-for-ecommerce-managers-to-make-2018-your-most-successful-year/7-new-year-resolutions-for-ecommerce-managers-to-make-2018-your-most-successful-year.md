It’s that time of year again. The new year brings along with it a fresh new wave of motivation and inspiration for many - which means everyone around us seems to be working on their new year resolutions (which they’ll most likely forget after a week or two). Sticking to new year resolutions is never easy, right?

This year, we’re going to make things easier for you (and your eCommerce store) by compiling a list of seven new year resolutions that will bring your eCommerce business success this coming new year.

  

1\. Time for a Website Makeover? ![Website_Makeover](../../webdeisgn.jpg)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of those things you always tell yourself needs doing but you never seem to get round to it - refreshing and updating your website design.

Look at heat maps to identify any problem areas on your website, and arrange a meeting with your eCommerce agency to discuss your thoughts and any new ideas. New year, new website, right?

  

2\. Launch a Loyalty Programme
------------------------------

What better way to start off the new year than by improving your retention strategy?

Reward your loyal customers with exclusive discounts, and work on retaining your new customers with special offers in a loyalty programme.

You can use loyalty programs for repeat customers too by providing incentives to those who demonstrate loyal buying behaviour.

  

3\. Add Live Chat
-----------------

Add live chat support to sway hesitant customers and increase sales.

A great way to exceed customer expectations and ensure your customers complete their transaction is by helping them through the process if they have any problems and making it easier for them to make their purchase.

  

4\. On-Site Personalisation
---------------------------

This year, make a conscious effort to get more personal with your customers and increase sales with specific, personalised campaigns and offers for them.

Analyse customer behaviour to get to know them better and keep them interested with specific offers - [Nosto](https://www.nosto.com/) is a great tool for this and delivers automated, personalised recommendations to customers based on what they like.

  

5\. Refine Your Returns Policy
------------------------------

Truthfully speaking, product returns are something we all dread. But there’s no trying to avoid it - so make the process more satisfactory for your customers by implementing tools that will allow them to return products without any hassle, and lesson some of the frustration you yourself feel.

Tools like [Returnly](https://apps.shopify.com/returnly) allows you to deliver a friction free returns experience - so you (and your customers) can be sure of one less headache this new year!

  

6\. Improve Mobile Experiences ![Improve_Mobile_Experience](../../mobileusers.jpg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile moves fast. Make sure you’re working on keeping your site optimised for mobile users throughout the year.

The amount of mobile users making eCommerce transactions is expected to [grow over 2 billion by 2019, according to Nchannel](https://www.nchannel.com/blog/ecommerce-stats-trends-online-shopping/) - so it’s important to ensure your store is equipped to handle the rise of mobile users. Make checkout processes easier by implementing Apple Pay, or maybe work on launching an app for your store.

  

7\. Perfect Your Email Marketing With Automations & Personalisation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We all know emails are a great way to drive sales for your store- so you should be constantly working on improving your email campaigns and one of the key opportunities this year will be personalisation and automation.

Use automated emails to send your customers information at specific times or send emails triggered by behaviour, and ensure your emails are personalised to increase sales. Creating more consistency and urgency will also help to increase open rates and click-throughs.

  

8\. Refresh Your Photography ![Refresh_Product_Photogrpahy](../../camer.jpg)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product photography is the most effective way to promote your products. That’s why it’s important to make sure your visual content is of the highest quality possible.

Set up a meeting with your photographer to refresh your images, take new lifestyle photography and improve product images. New year, new photography!
