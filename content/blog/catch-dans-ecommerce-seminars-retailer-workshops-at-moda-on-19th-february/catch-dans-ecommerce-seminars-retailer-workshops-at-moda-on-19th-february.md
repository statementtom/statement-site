![Dan MODA 2018](../../Dan_Moda_Profile.jpg)We’re excited to announce that Dan will be heading back to [MODA](https://www.moda-uk.co.uk/), the UK’s largest fashion trade exhibition, on 19th February.

Dan will be taking to the MODA seminar stage to talk micro-influencers, and how you can leverage their followings to grow your business.

For businesses who aren’t able to work to work with the Kardashians of this world, micro-influencers make for a fantastic opportunity to grow, develop and spread the reach of their brand.

Dan will be speaking at 11:45am on 19th February, so don’t forget to head down to MODA’s catwalk theatre if you’re planning on attending the show.

Away from the main seminar program, Dan will also be running a retail workshop for MODA visitors, sharing his experience of multi-channel retail at 10:30am, and the secrets to online retail at 2pm on 19th February.

Workshop places are limited, so don’t miss your chance to [book your spot](https://www.moda-uk.co.uk/retail-workshops) while you still can.

**You can [register for MODA tickets here](https://registration.n200.com/survey/1j72fz3uy7ysz), or if you’re planning a micro-influencer strategy for your eCommerce brand, [get in touch](https://www.statementagency.com/contact-us) and let us know.**
