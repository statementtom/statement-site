Personalisation is by far one of the most common and effective marketing eCommerce strategies. And for those high growth eCommerce merchants on [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.co.uk/plus?ref=statement&utm_campaign=Statement%20Blog), you have a wealth of opportunities to improve personalisation for your store.

From automatically tagging customers based on actions taken, to personalising specific on site experiences, Shopify Plus provides users with a wide range of powerful tools and features to help you market better to your customers.

Here are just a few ways you can personalise your store with Shopify Plus...

  

Automatically segment customers based on specific actions (using Flow)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shopify Flow allows you to create workflows that are triggered by specific actions taken by your customers. This then enables you to segment different groups of customers based on how they behave on your site.

For example, you can set up a series of workflows for your customers based on their purchasing behaviour, using this to then segment and target them based on the information you have obtained. If a particular group of customers look to be higher spenders and purchase more frequently, you could use this information to present personalised messages when those users return to your site. For example, you could recommend products you know they’d like, or show personalised popups tailored to them.

The example below shows a workflow created when a customer spends more a $100 and puts them in a VIP category.

Personalise your checkout experiences for your customers with exclusive discounts, offers, shipping rates etc (using Scripts)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shopify Scripts can enable high growth eCommerce merchants to customise the checkout process for their customers, providing them with a more personalised experience when purchasing from your store.

Scripts allow you to set up exclusive discounts that can be enabled through checkout for your VIP customers, enable free shipping for VIP customers, discounts off products for first time customers etc.

Personalise customers buying experiences (using Flow’s workflows)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Shopify’s Flow feature allows you to set up workflows that will automatically log your customers buying habits and preferences. This then allows you to understand your customers behaviour, helping you to better understand how you can personalise online experiences for them when they return to your store.

The image below shows a simple example of this, with customers being segmented according to the product category they last purchased from. This information then allows you to personalise the on-site experience for your customers, recommending products and content that fit their preferences.
