About the Event
---------------

We’re delighted to announce that our Shopify meetup is returning for our second event on the **14th September** at **The Adelphi in Leeds**. The event is a perfect opportunity for online merchants, eCommerce leaders and Shopify Experts to network and share insights about retail trends and the industry-leading Shopify platform.

Our last event was a great success and we’re excited to be a part of the growing Shopify community in the North of England.

“We were delighted with the success of our first Shopify Meetup North event in Leeds. In response to the great feedback we received, we’re now really pleased to be able to announce the second event - which we’re confident will be an enjoyable and informative event for all those with an interest in the Shopify platform.” - **Dan Conboy, Managing Director of Statement.**

Speakers
--------

At the event, we will hear from three industry experts and we will discuss various ways that retailers and developers can grow their online stores, retain customers and take advantage of the many benefits that Shopify has to offer.

We can confirm that the first speaker for our event will be **Keir Whitaker**, part of the Partner Growth & Community team at Shopify who will be talking through theme building hints, tips and tricks for making sure your online store looks good and converts well!

Keir Whitaker is based in the UK and works on the Partner Growth & Community team at Shopify. You'll often find him at conferences and running workshops on Shopify theme building. You can [subscribe](https://keirwhitaker.com/newsletter/) to his newsletter, read his latest articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@keirwhitaker), listen to his [podcast](https://backtofrontshow.com/), and follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keirwhitaker).

  

Location and Time
-----------------

The event will be held at **The Adelphi in Leeds** from **6pm until 8pm** and we think there will be lots of Shopify insights whether you’re an existing Shopify retailer, an online store looking for a new platform or if you simply have a great idea for a new eCommerce brand.

_Please note: This event aims to be a networking opportunity for agencies, app developers, retailers and eCommerce thought leaders and as we do have limited spaces available, we’d like to request that only two delegates from each company or agency attend so that we can keep the event open for as many people and brands as we can. As much as we love our fellow agency friends, the event won’t be nearly as useful if we don’t have enough space for retailers or brands!_
