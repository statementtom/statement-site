Businesses that do not have mobile-friendly websites will be penalised on Google in April 2015 when their new algorithm update is released. Is your website responsive and mobile-friendly?

Being high and visible on Google searches is very important to all businesses who are focused on growing their business. But in order to build and maintain your Google rankings, you need to keep up-to-date on all of the updates that search engines roll out. They are constantly tweaking their systems so that when you search for something, the sites that the engine brings up are as relevant and high quality as possible.

Google’s new ‘tweak’ is to the ranking of websites that do not have websites that are easy to use on mobile devices. For some websites, the majority of their traffic in 2014 was coming from mobile and even tablets so it is important that internet users who are using their mobile to access their favourite websites get a smooth experience when doing so because it’s not just a handful of people anymore. As more people use mobiles to access their internet, Google will be adjusting how their search engine works to mimic how searchers work.

We have been building and developing mobile-friendly websites since 2012 and we continue to do so because of how crucial it is to the user experience. Hopefully this new algorithm update will mean an easier and more efficient experience for mobile users who are frustrated when using Google and having to click on multiple websites which are hard to use.

Google have used mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor for a while now but only a small scale - but they have [formally announced](https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html) that from April 21st, it will have a significant impact.

If you’re a business wanting to grow your business in 2015 but don’t have a mobile-friendly website, [get in touch](https://www.statementagency.com/contact-us) so that you don’t get left behind!
