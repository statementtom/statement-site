We’re excited to say that Statement will be playing a part in this year’s [eCommerce MasterPlan Virtual Summit](https://academy.ecommercemasterplan.com/p/ecommerce-masterplan-virtual-summit-2017/).

As the only week long virtual summit in eCommerce, eCommerce MasterPlan will bring you over 20 speakers across 5 days on everything from email marketing to boosting conversions.

In its inaugural year, the eCommerce MasterPlan Virtual Summit aims to help existing eCommerce business owners identify new strategies for growth and we’re excited to say that Statement will be both speaking at and sponsoring the event.

In our session, our Managing Director, Dan Conboy walks through everything you need to know about Magento 1’s end-of-life, and how switching to Shopify could open up some fantastic opportunities for your eCommerce business.

He’ll be joined by summit organiser and best selling eCommerce author Chloe Thomas, who’ll be asking questions and chatting to Dan about making the switch to Shopify.

**You can catch our session from Friday 22nd September, and** [**book your place on the eCommerce MasterPlan Virtual Summit**](https://academy.ecommercemasterplan.com/p/ecommerce-masterplan-virtual-summit-2017/) **on their website.**
