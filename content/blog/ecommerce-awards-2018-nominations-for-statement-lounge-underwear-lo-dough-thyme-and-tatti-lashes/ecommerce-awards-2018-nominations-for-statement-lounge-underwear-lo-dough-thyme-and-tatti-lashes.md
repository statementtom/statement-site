**We’re excited to announce that Statement, along with clients [Lounge Underwear](https://loungeunderwear.com/), [Lo-Dough](https://lodough.co/), [Thyme](https://www.itsthyme.co.uk/) and [Tatti Lashes](https://tattilashes.com/) have received nominations for the [eCommerce Awards 2018](https://www.ecommerceawards.london/), with winners to be announced in London at the London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square on 26th September!**

After another incredible year for all of us at Statement, we’re proud to have been nominated for the Best Agency award at the upcoming eCommerce Awards 2018.

We’ve spent 2018 working hard for our Shopify and Shopify Plus clients, welcoming four new members to the Statement team and continuing to run our Shopify Meetups and other eCommerce events throughout the year. We wish all the other agencies the best of luck and it’s bound to be a great night celebrating agency successes in eCommerce.

As well as our own nomination, we received nominations for clients Lounge Underwear, Lo-Dough, Thyme and Tatti Lashes.

  

Lounge Underwear - Best Fashion eCommerce
-----------------------------------------

[Lounge Underwear’s](https://loungeunderwear.com/) incredible growth has been rewarded with a nomination for Best Fashion eCommerce. Lounge have used the power of Shopify Plus to build their brand from the ground up, with very little investment, in a short space of time.

  

Lo-Dough - Best Food & Drink eCommerce
--------------------------------------

[Lo-Dough](https://lodough.co/), winners of a Northern eCommerce Award last year, are continuing their fantastic success with a nomination for Best Food & Drink eCommerce. We couldn’t be happier for the Lo-Dough team after their hard work in bringing their innovative bread alternative to market.

  

Thyme - Best Food & Drink eCommerce
-----------------------------------

Also nominated in the Best Food & Drink eCommerce category, [Thyme](https://www.itsthyme.co.uk/) have this year undergone a rebrand, with a new bespoke site design from Statement. It’s great to see their passion for amazing quality frozen food rewarded with an award nomination too!

  

Tatti Lashes - Best Health & Beauty eCommerce
---------------------------------------------

Finally, [Tatti Lashes](https://tattilashes.com/) have received a nomination for Best Health & Beauty eCommerce. Their fast growth has been fantastic to witness over the past year, with their great product and hugely effective influencer marketing strategy making them worthy nominees.

  

Good Luck to the Nominees!
--------------------------

It’s amazing to see the work of our team and of our clients recognised with nominations for such fantastic awards. The eCommerce Awards 2018 take place on 26th September at London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square.

We want to wish everyone nominated good luck, and we can’t wait for what promises to be a fantastic night!
