**With a total of three awards from our 8 nominations, we’re excited to announce that Statement are the most decorated agency at [The Northern eCommerce Awards 2018](https://northernecommerceawards.com/2018-Winners).**

After leading the field with 8 nominations, Statement and our clients picked up the awards for Food and Drink eCommerce Website of The Year with our client [Lo-Dough](https://lodough.co/), as well as eCommerce Startup of the Year and Beauty, Health and Wellbeing eCommerce Website of the year with [Tatti Lashes](https://tattilashes.com/) at Manchester’s Hilton Deansgate.

Statement MD Dan Conboy comments;

_“It’s absolutely fantastic to have picked up 3 awards at The Northern eCommerce Awards. I’m really proud of the Statement team for all their efforts and grateful to our clients for the opportunity to work on some of the best eCommerce projects around.”_

These fantastic accolades follow straight on the back of our [recent acquisition by the IDHL Group](https://www.statementagency.com/blog/2018/10/statement-is-now-part-of-the-idhl-group), as well as five nominations at the 2018 eCommerce Awards in London back in September.

The Food and Drink eCommerce Website of The Year win for low calorie bread and pastry alternative client Lo-Dough follows on from their taking home the eCommerce Startup of the Year award in 2017. It’s amazing to see Lo-Dough continue to grow quickly with Statement and Shopify.

A huge thanks to the Northern eCommerce Awards for a great evening, we can’t wait for next year!
