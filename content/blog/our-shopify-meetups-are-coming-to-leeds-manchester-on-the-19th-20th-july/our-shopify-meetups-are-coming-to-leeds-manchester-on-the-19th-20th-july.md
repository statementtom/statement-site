After successfully holding three previous Shopify Meetups, this July we’re expanding the event to both Leeds and Manchester with some great speakers.

We’ve had some fantastic feedback from our previous three Shopify Meetup events in Leeds, meeting some fantastic merchants and developers from the growing Shopify community in the North.

As a testament to the rapid growth of the Shopify community, we’re responding by holding successive meetup events in Leeds and Manchester over two days this July!

On Wednesday 19th July, our Shopify Meetup event will return to [The Adelphi](https://www.theadelphileeds.co.uk/) in Leeds with some great speakers and insight from Shopify industry leaders such as [Space Squirrel](https://spacesquirrel.co/) and [Dexters](https://www.dextersworkwear.co.uk/).

The following day, we’ll host our first meetup in Manchester, at [LEAF](https://thisisleaf.co.uk/manchester/). We can’t wait to bring our Shopify Meetup to Manchester for the first time, and are co-hosting the event in conjunction with [Space Squirrel](https://spacesquirrel.co/), one of the countries leading Shopify app developers. Space Squirrel develop simple-to-use, smart and efficient Shopify apps and are a huge Shopify success story, making having them on-board an exciting prospect for attendees. The Manchester meetup will have many speakers including [Space Squirrel](https://spacesquirrel.co/), [Dexters](https://www.dextersworkwear.co.uk/) and our friends over at [Brightpearl](https://www.brightpearl.com/).

Both days promise to be packed with insight, with everyone from seasoned Shopify merchants to budding developers welcome.

If you’d like to attend either meetup, just book your free tickets for the [Leeds meetup here](https://nvite.com/ShopifyMeetup/j741rz), and tickets for the [Manchester meetup here](https://nvite.com/ShopifyMeetup/4onqw3).
