As part of this year’s Leeds Digital Festival we’re excited to be holding an eCommerce roundtable, bringing together eCommerce thought leaders, experts, partners and platforms to discuss the common traits of high-growth brands.

While high street retailers continue to face challenges, online brands like Gymshark, MVMT Watches and more are scaling quickly and flourishing.

But what's the secret to their success?

The roundtable takes place on Tuesday 24th April at 10am at Duke Studios Leeds, and will discuss marketing strategies, platform choices, tools and software and more, all within a confidential environment.

This event is aimed at eCommerce Managers, Heads of Marketing, Marketing Managers, Heads of eCommerce or equivalent at growing retail and eCommerce brands. As this is an event with limited seating and space, we do recommend that you request a place as soon as possible.
