We’re proud to announce that Statement has become one of a select group of northern agencies to join the newly established [Breadwinner agency program](https://breadwinneragencies.com/), looking to boost investment into the northern digital economy.

As the first agency intermediary platform in the north of England, Breadwinner was set up to be a ‘market for marketing’, making it easier for companies to find agency partners from across the north - whether this is eCommerce agencies like ourselves, branding and design agencies, PR agencies or even video partners.

As one of the first 32 agencies to take part in the program, we’re excited to be involved in the growth of the northern digital industries, and look forward to seeing Breadwinner expand and give northern agencies a real boost.
