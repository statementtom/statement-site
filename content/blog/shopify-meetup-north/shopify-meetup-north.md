The first of many meetups in the North for retailers, developers and partners to discuss online opportunities using the Shopify platform.

We’re excited to announce the first of many Shopify Meetup North events on the 25th May – an evening for online merchants and Shopify Experts to network and share insights about eCommerce trends and the industry-leading Shopify platform.

**Date:** Wednesday 25th May 2016

**Time:** 6pm - 8pm

**Venue:** Future Labs, Leeds (2nd Floor 1 Eastgate, Leeds, LS2 7LY)

After seeing many successful meetup events for Shopify in the US, across Europe and in London, we realised that there were no similar events happening in the North. But there’s definitely a growing Shopify community here and we’re looking forward to being a part of it.

In our first meetup, our theme will be personalisation. How can you personalise the online experience for your customers? We will also be discussing key insights from Unite (Shopify’s partner conference) and will hear expert talks from eCommerce thought leaders:  

**Dan Conboy, Managing Director of Statement**

Statement is a leading eCommerce agency with Shopify Experts status and Dan has recently returned from the 2016 Unite conference, so will be sharing key insights and developments directly from Shopify.  

**Ben Prince, Business Development Manager of Bunting**

Bunting is a Shopify personalisation app that makes it easy to personalise your website, increase sales and delight each and every visitor. Ben will be talking about how to use personalisation to help grow your online store.  

**Nicole Szekeres,** **Director of Marketing at Fusion Bags**

Fusion Bags is an established retailer of high quality, premium bags for musical instruments. They currently use Shopify and have done for the past two and a half years after having issues with other platforms in the past. Nicole will be speaking about her experiences with running a business using Shopify and offering advice and insights for other retailers.

The event will be held at **Future Labs** **in Leeds** (2nd Floor 1 Eastgate, Leeds, LS2 7LY) from **6pm until 8pm** and will be a great opportunity for retailers and developers to learn more about what Shopify can offer. We think that the event will be useful whether you’re an existing Shopify retailer, an online store looking for a new platform or if you simply have a great idea for a new eCommerce brand – so [be sure to book your place here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/shopifymeetupnorth-shopify-ecommerce-networking-event-leeds-tickets-24775538302)!

We hope to see you there!
