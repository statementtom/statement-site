Tatti Lashes have quickly become a household name when it comes to the health and beauty industry, selling a range of luxury mink, Brazilian silk hair and 3D lashes.

Using Shopify’s variety of features and the power of their strong online presence to bring their products to customers around the world, they’ve seen incredible success since their launch.

We’ve worked with Tatti Lashes for almost a year now, helping to optimise their site to create a more seamless experience for customers, and drive more sales and conversions.

We recently caught up with their digital director, Ryan Barton, to talk about their journey so far.

  

What is Tatti Lashes, and can you sum up what you do in 10 words?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

_An energetic e-commerce business that offers high quality, affordable eyelashes._

  

What are the key successes you've seen over the past year?

_Having celebrities such as Khloe Kardashian and Nicki Minaj wearing our product. The continued growth in the US market and being the number one eyelash brand online in the UK within the space of 12 months._  

Tatti Lashes’ rapid growth in a short space of time and the increasing popularity of their products has been incredible to witness! The rise in popularity and multiple celebrity endorsements have been massive successes, leading to accelerated growth in both the UK and US markets.

  

What's been the biggest challenge so far for the brand?
-------------------------------------------------------

As with any high-growth eCommerce store, Tatti Lashes have encountered their fair share of challenges along the way too. We asked Ryan what the biggest challenge has been so far.

_To adapt to such rapid growth with only a small team, whilst also keeping up to date with the latest technological trends._

Trying to keep up with changes in technology and fast moving trends can be difficult, especially for eCommerce clients who not only have to keep up with changes in technology and the digital environment, but also have to keep a close eye on changes in consumer and shopping behaviours.

However, Tatti Lashes have adopted an integrated marketing approach to reach out to customers, working hard not only on acquisition but also on retention.

  

What are the ambitions and plans for the future? ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cLrlLoFQITk3m5eER7phi57Iq5GQ2WwMTj8YkxDrxA_-mzFC3GFckokVT01H0jV00YZ1uZTaRB5YHg1OIK35m3CKS6Of2d8Y96Nn0y0rcKcRJQa_mZvMkOpasPM184Mv8cf9xgZv)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_To continue to grow in overseas markets and be as big offline as we are online._

Tatti Lashes have created a strong online presence, and we look forward to seeing how their offline presence will grow with this. So far, the celebrity endorsements have helped them to become a hugely popular brand, which will allow them to start building their offline presence too.

  

What's been the most exciting part of Tatti Lashes' success for you, personally?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Being part of a rapid journey and playing a significant role in the day to day growth of our business. Personally, it also brings a feel good factor seeing such results for a family-invested business._

  

How are you using marketing to grow and drive awareness?
--------------------------------------------------------

_Our brand is very social media friendly. We use an integrated marketing approach on all digital platforms to focus on new audience acquisition and retention._

Focusing on both acquisition and retention marketing strategies is helping Tatti Lashes grow as a brand but is also allowing them to establish a strong foundation for their existing customers too - crucial for continued growth.

  

Any top tips for other companies wanting to grow their brand?

_Establish an identity, understand who your customers are and leverage the content you have to the maximum._

Leveraging UGC is an incredibly effective strategy, allowing you to provide your customers with the opportunity to feel valued whilst also taking advantage of the wealth of content put out there by your customers.

  

Finally - how did you hear about Statement?
