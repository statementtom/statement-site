Shopify - and now Shopify Plus - is a fantastic eCommerce platform for startups and small businesses. The ability to focus on sales and growing an eCommerce business rather than hosting and solving technical problems has made it the best choice for small and medium sized eCommerce businesses around the world.

But Shopify isn’t just for small businesses…

It’s an incredibly powerful and capable platform whatever the size, and the development of [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.co.uk/plus) has reinforced this. There are plenty of huge, international brands and celebrities using Shopify to strengthen their brand image and sell everything from new music to car upgrades.

Here’s an updated list of the many celebrities and huge brands who’ve chosen Shopify or Shopify Plus:

  

Lady Gaga
---------

[Lady Gaga](https://shop.ladygaga.com/) uses the enterprise platform Shopify Plus as a sub-domain of her main site. A simple design makes the site easy to navigate, perfect for picking up a new album or tour t-shirt with little fuss.

The flexibility of the Shopify platform makes it easy to change the look and feel of the site from album to album. Using Shopify allows the international pop star to always remain on brand and keep her store ready for new releases.

  

Adele
-----

When it comes to traffic spikes, very little could compare to an [Adele](https://shop.adele.com/) album release. The music icon’s merchandise store is based on Shopify Plus to cope with her huge popularity and following. A simple, understated and premium design matches her brand perfectly and helps sell what will no doubt be an incredible amount of merchandise.

The store even allows shoppers to choose click and collect for their orders. Placing orders online and then picking them up from a show when they attend. Small innovative touches like this show why Shopify is becoming the first choice for many large brands.
