Statement is proud to be one of the district’s leading [eCommerce](https://www.statementagency.com/services/ecommerce) agencies and after more than 10 years of experience in the sector, we have learnt a great deal about what makes an online business thrive. It’s because of this that our director, Dan Conboy, will be leading a seminar at the forthcoming Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce’s 60 Useful Minutes event.

In this seminar, Dan will address the fundamentals of eCommerce - from initial planning and research to creating a focused marketing plan. By covering all of these key areas, you can prepare your business for the challenges of running a successful eCommerce operation. We also hope to enlighten business owners as to the opportunities that eCommerce can bring, along with the avenues that can bring you the best return.

The seminar is open to anybody, whether you are just thinking about setting up an online shop or if you already have one but you’re not seeing the return on investment that you'd anticipated. Our eCommerce experience is extensive and we believe that eCommerce strategy is one of Statement’s key strengths as an agency. It’s a startling statistic that up to 97% of online businesses could be under-performing. We want your business to belong to the 3% that lives up to its full potential.

The event, which includes talks from a number of guest speakers, will be held at New Commerce House this Thursday 22nd May from 8:30am - 10.00 am, along with a light breakfast. The event is free for members and just £5 for non-members.

You can register your place on the event on the [Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce website](https://www.mycci.co.uk/events/2229-60-useful-minutes-ecommerce-how-to-successfully-sell-online-and-grow-your-business), and don’t forget to [let us know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/statementagency) if you’re planning to join us – we hope to see you there!
